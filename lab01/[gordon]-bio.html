        My name is Hannah Gordon. I am a marketing management major interested in working for an entertainment company or sports team on brand management or product communication. Some of my skills include a Microsoft Excel certification and strong knowledge in al Microsoft suite.  In addition, I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop. Outside of school I love to ski, hike, and be at the beach. The best thing about living in California is I get to do all of those things in the same place! I am an avid sports fan loyal to all New York teams which often leaves me disappointed. I love to drink coffee and read outside in the mornings. My favorite book is Daisy Jones and the Six.
