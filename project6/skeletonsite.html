    <p>Christina Angelina is a LA native and UCLA grad who uses large and unique landscapes as her canvases. Although Angelina has taken her talents around the world, the chaos of the Venice Beach boardwalk has always been home, and she continues to portray real people reflecting raw emotions such as fear, hope, and serenity. This mural is located in the Arts district in downtown LA: a beautiful and intimate moment between two women that is sure to make you stop and stare, feeling every emotion she put into the piece. <br>
    "My work is emotional, intuitive, reflective, and I try to always consider the location, both aesthetically and energetically," she says. "I am mostly inspired by personal experience: people and places and artwork that I come in contact with" (The Creators Project)</p>

    “Holding on to futile permanence is a symptom of fear, a fear that the future unknown is less controllable and might be worse, but by resisting the unknown we spoil today, and resist the opportunity for something more beautiful to be created” David Puck</p>
